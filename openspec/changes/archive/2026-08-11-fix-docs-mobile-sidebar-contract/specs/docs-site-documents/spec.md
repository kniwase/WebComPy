# docs-site-documents delta: fix-docs-mobile-sidebar-contract

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The docs section shall use a nested-route shared layout

The `/documents` route SHALL be a parent route whose component (`DocsLayout`) renders a sectioned sidebar and a nested `RouterView`. Sibling navigation between docs pages SHALL preserve the layout instance (per RouterView level reuse), so the section-open sidebar state survives page transitions. The transient mobile sidebar overlay SHALL close when a navigation completes, so the destination page is unobstructed on narrow viewports.

#### Scenario: Layout persists across sibling navigation

- **WHEN** a user navigates from one docs page to another docs page
- **THEN** the sidebar is not remounted and its section-open state is preserved
- **AND** the mobile sidebar overlay is closed after the navigation completes

#### Scenario: Sidebar shows current page as active

- **WHEN** the user is on `/documents/getting-started/installation`
- **THEN** the corresponding sidebar `RouterLink` carries its `active_class` and `aria-current="page"`
