## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The dev server shall serve application packages
The dev server SHALL build a single bundled Python wheel containing both the webcompy framework and the application, and serve it at the `/_webcompy-app-package/` endpoint so that PyScript can load it in the browser.

#### Scenario: Starting the dev server
- **WHEN** a developer runs `python -m webcompy start --dev`
- **THEN** the server SHALL build a single bundled wheel containing both webcompy and the application code
- **AND** serve it at `/_webcompy-app-package/{filename}`
- **AND** the browser SHALL be able to import both `webcompy` and the application package

#### Scenario: Dev server with assets
- **WHEN** a developer configures `assets={"logo": "images/logo.png"}` in `WebComPyConfig`
- **THEN** the bundled wheel SHALL include the matching asset files inside the package tree
- **AND** an `_assets_registry.py` module SHALL be generated in the app package mapping `"logo"` to its package path
- **AND** `load_asset("logo")` SHALL return the file content as `bytes`

### Requirement: The generate command shall produce deployable static files
Running `python -m webcompy generate` SHALL produce a complete static site in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

#### Scenario: Generating a multi-page application with history mode
- **WHEN** routes are defined with history mode
- **THEN** an `index.html` SHALL be generated for each route path
- **AND** a `404.html` SHALL be generated for unmatched paths
- **AND** a single bundled wheel SHALL be placed in `dist/_webcompy-app-package/`
- **AND** static files SHALL be copied from the configured directory
- **AND** a `.nojekyll` file SHALL be created for GitHub Pages compatibility

#### Scenario: Generating a single-page application with hash mode
- **WHEN** no router or hash mode is used
- **THEN** a single `index.html` SHALL be generated at the dist root
- **AND** all other assets SHALL be included as in the history mode case

### Requirement: Generated HTML shall include PyScript bootstrapping
Every generated HTML page SHALL include PyScript v2026.3.1 CSS and JS, a loading screen, the app div (either pre-rendered or hidden), and a PyScript configuration specifying all required Python packages. The configuration SHALL reference a single bundled wheel (not separate framework and application wheels) and SHALL NOT include `typing_extensions` as a dependency.

#### Scenario: Inspecting generated HTML
- **WHEN** a generated `index.html` is examined
- **THEN** it SHALL contain a `<script type="module">` tag loading PyScript
- **AND** a `<script type="py">` tag with the bootstrap code
- **AND** a `<style>` tag with scoped component CSS
- **AND** a loading screen div with `id="webcompy-loading"`
- **AND** the PyScript packages list SHALL reference a single bundled wheel URL
- **AND** `typing_extensions` SHALL NOT appear in the packages list

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Application configuration shall support assets
`WebComPyConfig` SHALL accept an `assets` parameter that maps string keys to file paths relative to the app package directory. These assets SHALL be included in the bundled wheel and accessible at runtime via `load_asset`.

#### Scenario: Configuring assets for application resources
- **WHEN** a developer specifies `assets={"logo": "images/logo.png", "config": "data/settings.json"}`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL include the referenced files in the bundled wheel inside the app package tree
- **AND** an `_assets_registry.py` module SHALL be generated mapping `"logo"` to `"app/images/logo.png"` and `"config"` to `"app/data/settings.json"`
- **AND** those files SHALL be accessible via `load_asset("logo")` and `load_asset("config")` in the browser environment

#### Scenario: Omitting assets
- **WHEN** a developer does not specify `assets`
- **THEN** only Python source files, stub files, and `py.typed` markers SHALL be included in the wheel
- **AND** no `_assets_registry.py` module SHALL be generated

### Requirement: Assets shall be loadable by key at runtime
The `webcompy.assets` module SHALL provide a `load_asset(key: str) -> bytes` function and an `AssetNotFoundError` exception. When called, `load_asset` SHALL look up the key in the app's `_assets_registry` module and return the file content as `bytes` using `importlib.resources`.

#### Scenario: Loading an asset by key
- **WHEN** `load_asset("logo")` is called in browser code where `_assets_registry` maps `"logo"` to `"app/images/logo.png"`
- **THEN** the function SHALL return the raw `bytes` content of `app/images/logo.png`

#### Scenario: Asset key not found
- **WHEN** `load_asset("nonexistent")` is called
- **THEN** `AssetNotFoundError` SHALL be raised with the key as an attribute

#### Scenario: No assets registry module
- **WHEN** `load_asset` is called but the `app._assets_registry` module cannot be imported
- **THEN** `AssetNotFoundError` SHALL be raised
