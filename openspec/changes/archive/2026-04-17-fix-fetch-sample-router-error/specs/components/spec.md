## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Component after-rendering lifecycle hook shall be deferred when triggered by reactive navigation
When a component's `on_after_rendering` hook is triggered as a side effect of a reactive change (such as a route change via `SwitchElement._refresh()`), the hook SHALL NOT execute synchronously within the reactive callback chain. Instead, it SHALL be deferred to run after the reactive propagation has completed and the DOM is fully updated.

#### Scenario: Navigating to a page that starts async operations in on_after_rendering
- **WHEN** a user clicks a `RouterLink` to navigate to a new page
- **AND** the new page component has an `on_after_rendering` hook that starts an async operation (e.g., `HttpClient.get()`)
- **THEN** the async operation SHALL execute successfully without errors
- **AND** the component SHALL be fully mounted in the DOM before `on_after_rendering` fires

#### Scenario: Direct URL access to a page with on_after_rendering
- **WHEN** a page is loaded directly via URL (initial hydration)
- **AND** the page component has an `on_after_rendering` hook
- **THEN** `on_after_rendering` SHALL fire after the component is fully rendered
- **AND** the behavior SHALL be consistent with the deferred behavior during navigation

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Components shall manage their lifecycle
Components SHALL provide hooks for before rendering, after rendering, and before destruction. These hooks allow components to perform side effects like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or cleaning up resources. When `on_after_rendering` is triggered as part of a reactive update cascade (e.g., during `SwitchElement._refresh()`), it SHALL be deferred until after the reactive propagation completes, ensuring the DOM is fully settled before side effects run.

#### Scenario: Fetching data before rendering
- **WHEN** a component registers `on_before_rendering` to load data from an API
- **THEN** the data SHALL be available before the component renders

#### Scenario: Cleaning up before destruction
- **WHEN** a component is removed from the DOM
- **THEN** its `on_before_destroy` callback SHALL fire
- **AND** the component's title and meta entries SHALL be removed from the document head

#### Scenario: After-rendering hook during route navigation
- **WHEN** a component's `on_after_rendering` hook fires as a result of a route change (i.e., `SwitchElement._refresh()` replacing one component with another)
- **THEN** the hook SHALL execute after the entire DOM update and reactive propagation has completed
- **AND** any async operations started in the hook SHALL run in a clean event loop context
