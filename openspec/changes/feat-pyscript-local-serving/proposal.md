# Proposal: PyScript Local Serving — Same-Origin PyScript Runtime for Offline PWA Support

## Summary

Download and serve the PyScript runtime (core.js, core.css) and Pyodide engine (pyodide.mjs, pyodide.asm.wasm, python_stdlib.zip) from the same origin as the WebComPy application. This is the final level of local serving, enabling complete offline PWA support when combined with the dependency and WASM local serving changes.

## Motivation

1. **Offline capability**: Even with dependencies served locally (levels 3 and 4), the app still depends on the PyScript CDN for the runtime. Serving the runtime locally enables complete offline operation.

2. **PWA/ServiceWorker**: Same-origin runtime assets are required for ServiceWorker caching. Cross-origin CDN resources cannot be cached by a ServiceWorker in many configurations.

3. **Air-gapped environments**: Intranet deployments or environments without internet access need all assets served locally, including the runtime.

4. **Privacy/compliance**: No external requests for the JavaScript runtime means no CDN tracking.

## Known Issues Addressed

None (new capability).

## Non-goals

- This does not change the default build mode (CDN mode remains default).
- This does not implement ServiceWorker registration or PWA manifest generation — those are future enhancements.
- This does not implement split/detached wheel mode — that is `feat-split-mode`.

## Dependencies

- **Requires** `feat-dependency-bundling` — the lock file and single-bundle wheel are prerequisites.
- **Benefits from** `feat-deps-local-serving` — pure-Python packages served locally.
- **Benefits from** `feat-wasm-local-serving` — WASM packages served locally.
- These three changes together enable **complete offline operation**.

## Layered Architecture

```
Level 1: feat-dependency-bundling (current)
  WASM ─────────── CDN (packages名で読み込み)
  純Py ────────── バンドル(ローカルインストール前提)
  PyScript/Pyodide ─ CDN

Level 2: feat-split-mode
  ホイール分割(フレームワーク/アプリ/依存関係)
  キャッシュ効率改善

Level 3: feat-deps-local-serving
  WASM ─────────── CDN
  純Py ────────── 同一オリジン配信(Pydide CDNからDL)
  PyScript/Pyodide ─ CDN

Level 4: feat-wasm-local-serving
  WASM ─────────── 同一オリジン配信(Pydide CDNからDL)
  純Py ────────── 同一オリジン配信
  PyScript/Pyodide ─ CDN

Level 5: feat-pyscript-local-serving (this change)
  WASM ─────────── 同一オリジン配信
  純Py ────────── 同一オリジン配信
  PyScript/Pyodide ─ 同一オリジン配信 ★
  → 完全オフライン動作可能
```

## Design

### Overview

```
DEFAULT MODE (no local serving):
  PyScript CDN ────── core.js, core.css
  Pyodide CDN ─────── numpy (WASM only — pure-Py packages bundled)
  WebComPy server ─── single bundled wheel

PYSRIPT LOCAL SERVING (this change):
  WebComPy server ─── core.js, core.css, pyodide.mjs, pyodide.asm.wasm,
                        pyodide.asm.js, python_stdlib.zip, pyodide-lock.json
                       (ALL runtime assets from same origin)
```

### Implementation Sketch

- `GenerateConfig` and `ServerConfig` gain a `standalone: bool = False` field.
- When `standalone=True`:
  1. PyScript `core.js`, `core.css` are downloaded at build time and served locally.
  2. Pyodide `pyodide.mjs`, `pyodide.asm.wasm`, `pyodide.asm.js`, `python_stdlib.zip` are downloaded and served locally.
  3. `pyodide-lock.json` is served locally (so micropip resolves against it).
  4. Generated HTML references all runtime assets via same-origin URLs.
  5. `py-config` `lockFileURL` is pointed at the local `pyodide-lock.json`.

### Download Strategy

At build time, `webcompy generate --standalone` (or equivalent) downloads all required runtime assets from CDN and places them in `dist/_webcompy-assets/`:

```
dist/
├── _webcompy-assets/
│   ├── core.js
│   ├── core.css
│   ├── pyodide.mjs
│   ├── pyodide.asm.wasm
│   ├── pyodide.asm.js
│   ├── pyodide-lock.json
│   └── python_stdlib.zip
├── _webcompy-app-package/
│   └── myapp-py3-none-any.whl
├── index.html
└── ...
```

(When combined with `feat-deps-local-serving` and `feat-wasm-local-serving`, the `_webcompy-assets/packages/` directory is also populated.)

### PWA Extension (Future)

A subsequent change could add:
- `GenerateConfig.service_worker = True` to generate a ServiceWorker script.
- `GenerateConfig.manifest = {...}` to generate a PWA manifest.
- Offline caching strategies for same-origin assets.

These are explicitly out of scope for this change but this change is a prerequisite.

## Specs Affected

- `cli` — add `standalone` flag, runtime asset download logic
- `app-config` — add `standalone` to `GenerateConfig` and `ServerConfig`
- `lockfile` — add `standalone_assets` lock file section
